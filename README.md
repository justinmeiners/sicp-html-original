# SICP HTML version archive

This is the HTML text for the classic textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
There are various projects that have cleaned it up to create a modern PDF or Epub. This is an archive of the original.

MIT just recently took down the book from their own site (why?!). I obtained it from [open courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/resources/sicp_fulltext/). It's license "Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 Unported License" allows me to redistribute it.


## Fun fact

The HTML for this book was created using [tex2page](http://ds26gte.github.io/tex2page/).
